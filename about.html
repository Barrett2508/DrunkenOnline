        <h2>About Drunken Lullabies</h2>
        <p>Drunken Lullabies is an ARK Survival Evolved cluster that has PvE servers for both PlayStation and PC. We have some great rates, an awesome community and an efficient and active admin team to run the cluster smoothly.</p>

        <p>At Drunken Lullabies we have always done things differently to stand out from the crowd and give our players a truly awesome place to play the game that we all love. We NEVER wipe our maps, instead we opt for regular "Cleanups" where the admins will go round and manually remove abandoned structures and dinosaurs meaning our players can have peace of mind that they will never lose their progress as long as they are active, or let us know they are going to be away anf request that we reset their timers on their behalf via our custom discord ticketing system.</p>

        <p>We also have custom made discord bots to make your time on our server more engaging by allowing users to earn coins that can be spent on flashy new discord roles, or in-game items! Fot those who would like to support the cluster via donations, we have extra perks as can be seen on the donations page.</p>

        <p>We truly value our community, and we run things in a professional manner, something that can be hard to find on a server these days! Members have a direrct vote on any changes that we make to our settings to make sure we have a great experience for everyone who plays here at Drunken Lullabies. Hop on in to our discord server today, and begin your journey with us!</p>
